# How Much Does Balloon Decoration Cost in 2026?

Planning a celebration and wondering how much professional balloon decoration will cost? In this article, we provide a complete price overview so you can plan your budget without surprises.

## What Affects the Price of Balloon Decorations?

The price depends on several factors. First is the **size of the decoration** — a small table garland costs much less than a large photo wall covering an entire wall. Second is the **type of balloons** — latex balloons are affordable, while foil balloons (metallic, numbered, or character-shaped) are more expensive. Third is the **design complexity** — a single-color garland is simpler than an organic garland with flowers, ribbons, and LED lights.

## Price Guide

### Balloon Garlands

Garlands are the most popular type of decoration. They create a striking visual impact and suit practically any occasion.

- **Mini garland (up to 1.5 m)** — from €80 to €120. Ideal for decorating a table, candy bar, or small photo corner.
- **Medium garland (1.5 – 2.5 m)** — from €120 to €180. The most common choice for birthday parties and smaller events.
- **Large garland (over 2.5 m)** — from €180 to €350. Suitable for weddings, corporate events, and large venues.

### Helium Balloons

- **Single helium balloon with weight** — from €4 to €6
- **Bouquet (5 balloons)** — from €20 to €35
- **Foil number balloons (70-100 cm)** — from €12 to €18 each

### Photo Walls and Complete Decorations

- **Simple photo wall** — from €150 to €250
- **Themed complete decoration** (garland + photo wall + helium balloons + accessories) — from €300 to €600

### Additional Services

- **Delivery and installation in Trenčín** — free for orders over €150
- **Delivery outside Trenčín** — from €0.50/km
- **Post-event removal** — from €30

## Typical Event Budgets

**Children's birthday** (at home or rented venue): €100 – €200. Usually includes a medium garland, several helium balloons, and a foil number decoration with the child's age.

**Wedding**: €250 – €600. Depends on scope — from an elegant garland above the head table to complete decoration of the entire venue including a photo booth.

**Corporate event or team building**: €200 – €500. Company colors, logos, and larger venues require more material.

**Graduation**: €80 – €150. Usually a smaller garland and a few helium balloons are enough.

## Why Order Professional Decoration?

Many people think they can do balloon decorations themselves. Yes, simple decorations perhaps. But a professional garland requires:

- **Correct balloon sizes** — an organic look requires 4-5 different sizes
- **Quality materials** — cheap store-bought balloons pop within hours
- **Installation experience** — the garland must hold all evening, not fall down after an hour
- **Design sense** — colors must harmonize, transitions must be smooth

Professional decoration lasts 2-3 days, looks stunning in photos, and you can focus on your guests instead of dealing with popping balloons.
